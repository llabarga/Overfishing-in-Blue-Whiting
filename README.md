# Study of overfishing of *Micromesistius poutassou*

Overfishing is a serious problem and therefore it is necessary to analyze the populations of commercial species such as Blue whiting to find out if more individuals are being extracted than what is marked by the RMS (maximum sustainable yield). Overfishing generates impacts on both marine ecosystems and economic or social. Eliminating this practice is essential to ensure the resilience of populations by allowing them to recover and remain healthy (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food).

In the subject **Marine Biology** we studied the populations of *Micromesistius poutassou*, a mesopelagic fish that inhabits both the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic. The objective was to find out if any of them are suffering from fishing pressure and, if so, to give recommendations for sustainable management and fishing of the populations.

Two batches of Micromesistius poutassou individuals were obtained, fished in 2 different areas. Sample size was 74 and 78 respectively and the following parameters were measured for each of the individuals:
* Weight
* Total length
* Maturity
* Sex
* Age

#### Blue whiting
I'ts distributed between 150 and 3000 m of depth with the largest schools of fish between 300-400 m, although juveniles are usually found at shallower depths than adults. Individuals make vertical migrations throughout the day to feed or protect themselves and north-south migrations associated with reproduction.

Regarding the reproductive success of the species, they reach their first maturity when they are between 0-4 years old depending on the geographical area they inhabit and when their size is around 15-18 cm (L50, length at which 50% of the fish in a population reach sexual maturity). They reproduce between December and March (Mir-Arguimbau et al.).

*M. poutassou* is a commercial species, that is, it is caught or farmed for sale, and therefore has a minimum size of 15 cm in the case of the Mediterranean, but in the Atlantic there is no minimum size (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food).

#### Indicators analysed

* Percentage of mature fish caught (it is expected to be 100%)
* Percentage of individuals that meet the minimum size (it is expected to be 100%) 
* Age of the individuals (this being the appropriate one for each species) (Froese, R. 2004)
* Overfishing can generate problems such as precocious maturity, which is the ability of individuals to mature sexually at a much earlier age than is typical for the species. This increase in the speed of maturation leads to a reduction in body growth. It is a mechanism that fish acquire to cope with sustained fishing pressure over time (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food).
